# RESTFUL API using php

This project was based on the specification for an assignment for module COMP519 Web Programming. 
The file stucture follows the assignment specification set by the lecturer. Specifically, no folders were allowed during submission.

This project/assignment uses PHP to make create the API endpoints using the REST sotware architecture. It uses HTML to create the 
interface and separate the frontend from the backend. CSS was used to make the site have a decent look. Javascript was used to
add minimal interactivity as contrained by the assignment. 

Overall, the output of the assignment needs improvement. However, it has managed to do give outputs through the API endpoints.
